Learning is not a race 
It would be very easy to blow through this class in four days simply stop following along and dont' complete any of the challenges could be done by friday 
the problem is that when you you are done you wont' actually understand javascript 
so It's going to take a little more time and that's ok maybe it's three weeks or maybe it's six months 
stay consistent put in a little time
